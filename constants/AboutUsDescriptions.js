The team name ‘Guacamoli’ was inspired by a popular Mexican cuisine called guacamole, which is not only tasty—but also healthy. Namely, we wish to bring a healthy and tasty life style to our fellow UST students and staffs by promoting awareness of what we eat at University.";
export const whatWeWant = "We want to ‘nutritionalize UST.’ While food constitutes a big part of our University life, only minority of people take time to know more about what they eat every day. Guacamoli will be the first to facilitate such movement. \n We want people to eat tasty food. Everyone has different preferences, but nobody can make a wise choice if there is not enough information. We aim to provide the information provider to people.\n We want communication between students and canteens. Through Guacamoli, we hope to provide a platform where students can actively give feedbacks to menus, and where canteens can use the platform to improve their services and marketing.";
export const howWeDoIt = "We provide photos for every single menu that we have in the website. People previously confused by menu names directly translated from Chinese (i.e. Shanghai Grandma Style Pork) can check the photos to see if a menu would fit their preference.\nFor vegetarians people allergic to certain ingredients, we provide ingredient information for all the menus. People can check the information before they order the menu. \n In a place where new menus are constantly updated, we aim to provide most up-to-date food information to people.
